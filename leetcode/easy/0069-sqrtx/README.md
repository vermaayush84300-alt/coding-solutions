# Sqrt(x)

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return  *the square root of* `x` *rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be  **non-negative**  as well.

You  **must not use**  any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x<2) return x;
        int l = 1, r =x/2 , ans=0;
        while(l<=r){
            long long mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            if(mid*mid<=x){
                ans=mid;
                l = mid+1;
            }
            else{
                r = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
