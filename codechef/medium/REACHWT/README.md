## Problem

### Reach Weight

You need to buy some weights that total to exactly $N$ kg.

You can buy either $1$ kg weights for $20$ rupees, or $2$ kg weights for $30$ rupees.

Find the minimum cost to buy such a set of weights that sum to $N$ kg.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line contains a single integer $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the minimum total cost of buying a set of weights that total to exactly $N$ kg.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 100$

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
  int T;
  cin>>T;
  while(T--){
      int N;
      cin>>N;
      int cost = (N/2)*30 + (N%2)*20;
      cout<<cost<<endl;
      
  }
}

```
